## Built-in Hedera Agent Kit

At its core, the plugin is powered by HederaAgentKit, which streamlines network interactions and automates common tasks. It supports:

* Real-time HBAR balance updates for the connected wallet
* Automated on-chain queries without requiring manual actions
*   Context-aware responses, allowing users to ask questions like:

    User: _What’s my HBAR balance?_\
    Response: _Your current HBAR balance is 999.81 HBAR._

This ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience, reducing friction when working with the Hedera network.

# Hedera AI Agent Kit

The Hedera Agent Kit is an open-source toolkit that simplifies the integration of AI agents and frameworks into the Hedera network. It offers a LangChain-compatible suite of tools for easy network interaction, enabling autonomous AI frameworks to utilize Hedera’s services seamlessly. &#x20;

With this kit, intelligent agents (such as those powered by large language models) can create tokens, send consensus messages, and query ledger data on Hedera via simple high-level function calls. This bridges AI and blockchain. For example, demos have shown how users can initiate airdrops using natural language prompts through an AI agent, highlighting how the kit enhances AI capabilities and user experience on the Hedera network.&#x20;

## Key Functionalities

* **Create Tokens:** Quickly launch your own tokens with just a few parameters, such as name, symbol, and supply.
* **Create Topics:** Set up channels for messaging on Hedera, making it easy to start discussions or log events.
* **Send Messages:** Publish messages to topics without needing to handle the complex details behind the scenes.
* **Run Queries:** Easily check account balances, token details, or topic history to see what’s happening on the network.
* **Extra Tools:** Includes additional features like simple token transfers and airdrop tools to distribute tokens to multiple accounts at once.
